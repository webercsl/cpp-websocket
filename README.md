# WebSockets in C++
This project contains 2 programs: Client and Server. The main focus of the project is to better understand web sockets and multi-threading in C++. The ideia is that the server program simulates a printer, waiting for files to be queued, and that the client program simulates any device trying to send a file to the printer.
